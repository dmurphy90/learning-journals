# LEARNING JOURNAL DAY 17

Today we made alot of headway with our project, by the end of the day we were probably 70-80% of the way to MVP and will probably be at MVP by noon the next day. Since most of our app is based completely on the logic of the queue system, it's made it a slight bit harder to divide tasks up for everyone to work on at the same time because a lot of functionality is dependent on the queue system itself working first. But we've managed to pull through, and while we may be the last group to MVP we've got everything worked exactly like how we talked about it working.
