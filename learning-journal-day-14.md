# LEARNING JOURNAL DAY 14

Today we didn't learn anything to do with coding so much as we learned how a product pitch will go, and how to get started working with a team on said project. My project got a lot of votes from people to move past the selection round which made me really happy, and while not everyone was trying to work on it I got a solid team and am excited to see what we can do.
