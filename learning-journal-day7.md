# LEARNING JOURNAL DAY 7

Today we learned about constructor functions, which I personally love. Objects and constructors are something I seem to have a pretty clear grasp of, and constructors only make working with objects even easier. I still need to brush up on how understanding prototypes exactly work and when they get called though. Maybe I don't have all that clear of a grasp then..
