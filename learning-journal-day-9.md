# LEARNING JOURNAL DAY 9

Today we learned about how to use the tools in the Chrome Developer Console to debug our code. Overall this was a great thing to learn, while I am still far from a master of writing javascript or even really being good at it, the debugger console is a huge tool to help understand where your program is going wrong. Definitely going to be making good use of this.
