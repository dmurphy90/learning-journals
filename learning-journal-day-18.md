# LEARNING JOURNAL DAY 18

Today we made some of our last strides towards MVP, we got everything done except for defining what local storage we need to get everything working the way we want it. Got more practice making pop up boxes and forms that construct new objects based on input values. Then I started on the CSS styling and finished styling the login page, and tomorrow will do the styling on the student and admin pages.
