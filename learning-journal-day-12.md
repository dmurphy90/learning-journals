# LEARNING JOURNAL DAY 12

Today learned two important things, one being how to make a chart appear on our page using data we input but the most important thing being how to use libraries. We used the library of chart.js to save us the hassle of having to make our chart work which would have been so many lines of code. Today was a very important lesson because we learned that if there's a way to streamline something minor with a library, just use the library, Other developers went out of their way to make sure we could have tools like this at our hands.
