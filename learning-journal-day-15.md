# LEARNING JOURNAL DAY 15

Today we did a course recap of what we've covered over the past few weeks, and then we broke off into our teams and got to planning our project. I think the biggest thing we learned is how to diagram out what specifically needs to be done. We came to realize that some parts of our project needed more on the To Do list than others because of the complexity and that let us come up with a better plan of attack rather than just listing out several big tasks and jumping into it.
