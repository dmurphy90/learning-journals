# Day 5 Learning Journal

Today we went over a recap of what we've learned this week with a brief rundown of key vocab and terms. Then we dove heavily into CSS elements and made a mock up of a website. Overall I'm still fairly weak with CSS but I don't think it's so much that I don't understand since a lot of things except for floats are pretty straight forward, I think it's more that I just don't know all the tools available to me so I'm kind of trying to paint Water Lilies but all I have is finger paints.

After with the lab we solved 5 problems that were pre-written and practiced utilizing branches in git for changes and then committing them to the master directory. I messed up on this at first by not pulling the new master at first, which caused me around 15 minutes of headaches but after that was sorted it was smooth sailing and I was able to hop back in the saddle and finish the work. I got to practice a bit more with for loops and while loops and functions, but am still nowhere near confident with anything above very basic functions and barely at all with loops so I'll definitely be diving into those hard this weekend. I didn't come here to skate by, and I'm not going to let myself do that.
