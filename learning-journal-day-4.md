# Day 4 Learning Journal

Today we dove into functions, which at first seem like they can be complicated but after looking at it more I've come to realize that ultimately functions can be easy, but they also can be incredibly complex and it's all up to how you want to make it. Right now I'm definitely struggling more with loops and using them to reference arrays.

We got paired off for a group project, and I got paired to Matt. At first when we sat down and started talking about what we needed to do I started to feel a bit overwhelmed like I didn't actually know how to do anything we were talking about. Instead of letting myself feel that way I went and grabbed a TA for an explanation, and he cleared things up for us. That was when I realized functions can be very easy and simple, and we took off with it. Once having a grasp of functions I drove at first and we knocked out turning Matts questions into functions, then finishing that up got to mine.

Overall I feel OK with functions, definitely far from mastering them or doing anything complex but I feel far more confident than I do with loops.
