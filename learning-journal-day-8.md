# LEARNING JOURNAL DAY 8

Today we learned about how to make forms, such as text-input forms number-input forms or radio selection forms. We also learned about events, such as on click or on keydown events and things like that. Overall I think these are pretty straightforward to grasp and to implement, but the trick will be structuring all the rest of your code to work off the dynamic nature of requiring form entries.
